## 🧠 About Me

Hi there! I’m **Nandhika Rajmanikandan**, a Master's student in **Data Science at Michigan Technological University** and a passionate explorer of everything from **machine learning pipelines** to **geospatial analysis**. I combine my love for storytelling, psychology, and data to create impactful, research-driven visualizations and solutions.  

I believe data is not just numbers—it’s people, places, and possibilities. Outside the data world, I thrive on writing, photography, dancing, and cooking my way through stress.
